# What is Tracy <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3578589/13300175/bad4d3c6-db36-11e5-94a4-aa4a9c3a9dbc.gif" width="50"/> ?
Tracy is an instrumentation library designed to capture Java code execution paths by capturing discrete transaction processing, telemetry events containing timing, call-flow-ancestry and host identification, along with any other context a developer would like to capture.

# Why does Tracy exist?
* I want to understand the performance characteristics of web applications at each tier/service through analysis of discrete transaction telemetry events.
* I want be able to record transaction metadata at any tier so I can then do ad-hoc analysis to better understand the effect user actions have on the system.
* I believe an Open Source APM core framework can provide standardized building blocks enabling an engineering team to gain insight into the dynamics of their system.
* I believe that with a standardized Open Source APM core, engineering teams can more easily build their own tools for increased application insight and analytics.

## Architecture
The Tracy library is part of a suite of components which make the Tracy framework. The Tracy framework objective is to capture telemetry in a manner such that it can be used to measure and analyze transactions passing through a system.

### Sample system

Consider a system made up of:
* Gateway
* Service 1
* Service 2

#### System flow
The diagram below depicts a Task (distinct user interaction with the system) being executed in the system.
A Task is defined by a discrete user interaction with the system with the intent to produce a result. In a HTTP context, it starts with a user Request and ends with a Response, including all of its inter-system interactions executed in the context of the request.

To understand the telemetry event model of Tracy it is important to understand the following concepts:
* `TracyFrame:` Telemetry (JSON) event containing identification of the Task, Component, Operation (e.g. class method name), Host and method before/after timing information.
```javascript
  {
    "taskId":"T-1234",
    "label":"gwServerMethod",
    "optId":"AAAA",
    "parentOptId":"0000",
    "msecBefore":1427817826500,
    "msecAfter" :1427817826620,
    "msecElapsed":120
  }
```
* `taskId:` Correlation identifier of a TracyTask (spanning multiple hosts/JVMs). taskId MUST be unique (i.e. must not be re-used for more than one Task)
* `label:` Identifier which will be used to identify the Operation (e.g. Java method)
* `optId:` Operation identifier, which identifies segment of code execution. optId is automatically generated by the Tracy library (MUST be unique within a taskId)
* `parentOptId:` The optId of the ancestor (calling method optId if in the same JVM, otherwise RPC originating method on the client JVM). parentOptId is the key to organize TracyFrames into a Graph.

These concepts become clearer when we look at a TracyTask as a graph for the sample system described above

The following code snippets illustrate how to inline instrument to produce the TracyFrames for the _Gateway_ component shown above.


_Context initialisation code:_
```java
public void servletInitialisationMethod() {
    Tracy.setContext("T-1234", "0000", "Gateway");
}
```

_Method instrumentation code:_
```java
public void gwServerMethod() {
  Tracy.before("gwServerMethod");
  // Do work
  gwClientMethod();
  Tracy.after("gwServerMethod");
}

public void gwClientMethod() {
  Tracy.before("gwClientMethod");
  // Calling Service1 here
  Tracy.after("gwClientMethod");
}
```

_Context termination code:_
```java
public void servletFinalizationMethod() {
    for (String event : Tracy.getEventsAsJson())  {
      System.out.println(event);
    }
    Tracy.clearContext();
}
```

If you want something a little more hands-on have a look at the Tracy simulator code in [hello-tracy project](https://github.com/joaovicente/hello-tracy/blob/master/src/main/java/com/apm4all/tracy/HelloTracy.java) or [TracyTest.java](https://github.com/joaovicente/Tracy/blob/develop/src/test/java/com/apm4all/tracy/TracyTest.java)

Another visualization which is particularly useful for performance analysis is the timeline

## Going further with Tracy
Peer Open Source projects
 [tracy-web-services](https://github.com/joaovicente/tracy-web-services) and [tracy-ui](https://github.com/joaovicente/tracy-ui) (screenshot below) then provide backend and visualization from Tracy events, including application performance statistics and drill-downs.

## Version history ##
